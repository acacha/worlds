## River Medway

The facilities provided by the Environment Agency on the River Medway make it one of the best rivers for paddle sports in the south of England, setting a gold standard for others to follow. There's a dedicated Medway Canoe Trail website (http://www.medwaycanoetrail.co.uk/), slipways at the start and end of the trail, free camping (without facilities) at Oak Weir Lock and Stoneham Disused Lock, a good campsite at Allington Lock, a shower and toilet block at Yalding, low level landing stages at all the locks making them easy to portage if required and uniquely a series of canoe passes/chutes which make it easy to travel downstream avoiding most of the locks entirely.

The canoe passes are graded from 1 (easy) to 3 (potentially dangerous), largely based on the speed of the chute. They are encountered in the following order: Tonbridge Town (Grade 1, portage alongside when dry), Eldridge's (Grade 1), Porter's (Grade 2), East (Grade 2), Oak Weir (Grade 2), Sluice Weir (Grade 3), Hampstead/Yalding (portage), Teston (Grade 1/2) and East Farleigh (portage). They are all suitable for a packraft and are exhilarating to descend. I found the narrower and steeper passes (Sluice Weir being the most extreme example) to actually be easier than the wider and slower ones (e.g. Oak Weir) where there's a tendency for the boat to turn sideways risking a scrape or a capsize. There are several online guides to the canoe passes which are worth reading before tackling them.

The canoe trail is challenging to do in a single day, but there are railway stations at regular intervals so it can be easily split, or completed as a two day trip, camping at one of the free campsites or at The Hop Farm campsite.

## Riu Wye

- Start at Hay-on-Wye, reached from Cardiff by the T14 bus (free at weekends). 
- It's also possible to start 5 miles upriver at Glasbury with river access from 10am to 4pm. In normal summer levels the river is straightforward with 
most rapids at grade 1, but even in summer the river can flood after heavy rainfall. 
- There are grade 2 rapids at Monnington Falls and Symond's Yat, which can be portaged if necessary. 
- A detailed guidebook should be consulted for details of all the rapids and how to negotiate them (e.g. the online **Environment Agency Canoeists' guide to the River Wye**). [Document](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/301603/gemi1011bujd-e-e.pdf)

Dias:
- **DAY 1**: is short with 4.6 miles paddling to Whitney-on-Wye where there's the Boat Inn pub and a campsite run by The Pound B&B. 
- **DAY 2**: is 12.8 miles to Bycross Farm campsite, with the Yew Tree pub a mile's walk away at Preston-on-Wye. 
- **DAY 3**: is 12 miles to Hereford with camping at the rowing club, with the Spread Eagle pub a short walk away by the cathedral. 
- **DAY 4** is 16.1 miles to Tresseck Campsite in Hoarwithy, with The New Harp Inn nearby. 
- **DAY 5** is 11.5 miles to Ross-on-Wye camping at White Lion Pub at Wilton Bridge. 
- **DAY 6** is 14 miles to Symonds Yat West, camping at the River Wye Caravan & Camping Park with pub Old Court Hotel nearby. 
- **DAY 7** is 12.4 miles to Bigsweir Bridge marking the start of the tidal river. It's possible to continue downriver to Chepstow, but this is more serious with high muddy banks, no intermediate landing places and dangerous weirs exposed at low tide. The tide was out, so I opted to walk the final 11 miles to Chepstow following Offa's Dyke path.

## Thames/Isis

Cal un permis que val uns 45Pounds (54,35 EUR): https://members.britishcanoeing.org.uk/waterways-licence/

A four day packrafting trip down the upper River Thames/Isis to Oxford. Start with a bus to Highworth from Swindon, then walk to the river at Hannington Bridge. The upper river is narrow, fast-flowing and can be blocked with fallen trees up to the first lock at Lechlade, where there's camping at the Trout Inn. Beyond here there are locks every few miles, the lock keepers are generally happy to let small craft through, although it's always possible to portage around, plus there's a new canoe pass at Radcot Lock. At the end of the second day food is available at the Trout Inn at Tadpole Bridge, with camping a mile away at Turkey Creek. At the end of the third day food is available at the Ferryman Inn, with camping a mile away at Home Farm. Many of the locks also have small camping areas.

4 dies:
- Lock: exclusa
