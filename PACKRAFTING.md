## Riu Wye

- Start at Hay-on-Wye, reached from Cardiff by the T14 bus (free at weekends). 
- It's also possible to start 5 miles upriver at Glasbury with river access from 10am to 4pm. In normal summer levels the river is straightforward with 
most rapids at grade 1, but even in summer the river can flood after heavy rainfall. 
- There are grade 2 rapids at Monnington Falls and Symond's Yat, which can be portaged if necessary. 
- A detailed guidebook should be consulted for details of all the rapids and how to negotiate them (e.g. the online **Environment Agency Canoeists' guide to the River Wye**).

Dias:
- **DAY 1**: is short with 4.6 miles paddling to Whitney-on-Wye where there's the Boat Inn pub and a campsite run by The Pound B&B. 
- **DAY 2**: is 12.8 miles to Bycross Farm campsite, with the Yew Tree pub a mile's walk away at Preston-on-Wye. 
- **DAY 3**: is 12 miles to Hereford with camping at the rowing club, with the Spread Eagle pub a short walk away by the cathedral. 
- **DAY 4** is 16.1 miles to Tresseck Campsite in Hoarwithy, with The New Harp Inn nearby. 
- **DAY 5** is 11.5 miles to Ross-on-Wye camping at White Lion Pub at Wilton Bridge. 
- **DAY 6** is 14 miles to Symonds Yat West, camping at the River Wye Caravan & Camping Park with pub Old Court Hotel nearby. 
- **DAY 7** is 12.4 miles to Bigsweir Bridge marking the start of the tidal river. It's possible to continue downriver to Chepstow, but this is more serious with high muddy banks, no intermediate landing places and dangerous weirs exposed at low tide. The tide was out, so I opted to walk the final 11 miles to Chepstow following Offa's Dyke path.
